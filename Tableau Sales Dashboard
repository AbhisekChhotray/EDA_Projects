• I have divided the Dashboard into 3 parts: - General Dashboard and Customer 
Purchase Behavior Dashboard, Customer Segmentation
• The 1st Dashboard one depicts the overall sales trend, profit, top income categories, 
etc. and all of them are designed keeping “sales” as base.
• The 2nd Dashboard is basically highlighting the behavior of customer towards their 
purchase patterns, top products that are preferred by the customers, etc. which would 
further help the company in channelizing their business strategy.
• The 3rd Dashboard basically points at how many customers are present (segments) and 
which all customers need to be paid attention, etc.
• Coming into the technical part (considered while making the dashboard): -
1. To handle the numbers, present under week and day column into more 
informatic format, I have converted them into date-time (Base/Start is 
considered from 01-01-2021) where exactly 2 years data is present to be 
analyzed in order to make a more informed dashboard/decision.
2. To represent the codes of Marital status, I have mapped them into married, 
etc., which further helped in making the Dashboard more understandable.
3. Columns which had certain null values, etc. are also handled properly to 
generate more meaningful data.
4. To take out the profit from sales, custom columns is made which derives 
calculation from discounts, etc. (COGS & profit per unit).
5. Certain other custom columns are also designed as per need basis while 
designing KPIs, RFM analysis, etc.

#To cater all the above pointers, respective calculated field are made for same#
